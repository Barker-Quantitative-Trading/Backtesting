# Testing
- Tests are a great way to ensure your code handles many cases and works as expected.
- The Example_Testing folder has an example of how tests are written with pytest which should be downloaded from the requirements file.
- If you are on VS Code you can simply run the tests by typing pytest in the root folder.
- You can also click the run button next to each test.
