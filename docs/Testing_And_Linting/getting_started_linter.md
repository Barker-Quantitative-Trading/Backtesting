# Linting
- A linter is a great way to ensure uniform code across developers and keep syntax similar.
- A linter is essentially a more specific compiler that looks at the style of code written.
- In VS Code download the pylint extension and then you should start seeing your code marked with errors.
- If I wanted to run the linter on say the whole testing file I would use the command "pylint Example_testing"
